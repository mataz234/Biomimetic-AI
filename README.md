## Basic concepts and goals
The goal of this project is to program a working model of a mind, taking inspiration from a very simplified brain connection diagram.

In this project the mind is considered as the emerging property of a series of neural networks. Information flows from the sensory inputs (green) trough two main pathways capable of influencing each other: 
- a smaller and faster pathway is an emotional network (depicted in purple) capable of learning but with many constrains.
- a bigger and slower network involving more complex abstract thoughts, planning, problem solving (colored in blue).

Continuous flows of information from the senses and within the networks leave an imprint. This can be done using tecnologies such as LSTM neural networks. 

An autonomous generation of information, wich can be simplified as immagination, will be implemented as a constant flow, manipolation and rearrangment of thought vectors. Some of it will be hardwired (resembling instincts) and some other will be learnt and forgotten.

A temporary blockage of sensory inputs and alteration of the autogenous network flow to favor neuronal pruning, backpropagation, and avoid overfitting will take time and will be similar to animal sleep. This could be achived doubbling the whole network, connecting the two "brain emisferes" and having them sleep one at the time.

Self image will be present as a usefull means of predicting outcomes of higher cognitive decisions (internal world simulation).
