### Biomimetic-AI
AI inspired by brain pathways.
Layout of the project shown here:

## Basic concepts
In this project the mind is considered as the emerging property of a series of neural networks. Information flows from the sensory inputs (green) trough two main pathways capable of influencing each other: 
- a smaller and faster pathway is an emotional network (depicted in purple) capable of learning but with many constrains.
- a bigger and slower network involving more complex abstract thoughts, planning, problem solving (blue).
Continuous flow of information from the senses and within the networks leave an imprint using recently improved techniques such as LSTM. An autonomous generation of information, wich can be simplified as immagination, usefull for planning based on self image is to be implemented in the higher level cognition area (blue).

## How to contribute
I'm a molecular neuroscientist with some programming knowledge so please contribute with code or suggestions.
